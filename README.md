# Dummy Example: Video Processing System

## Overview
This Dummy Video Processing System is a Python-based application designed for handling video feeds from cameras, performing object detection, identifying bounding box overlaps, and communicating results via MQTT. It's a prototype suitable for understanding the flow of video processing systems.

## Components
- **Camera Module (`DummyConsumer`)**: Handles the video feed from cameras.
- **Detection Module (`DummyPredictor`)**: Simulates object detection in video frames using a dummy YOLO model.
- **Logic Module (`BoundingBoxOverlapDetector`)**: Detects overlaps among the bounding boxes of detected objects.
- **Communication Module (`DummyMQTT`)**: Sends the results to a specified MQTT topic.
